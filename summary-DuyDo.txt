I performed several critical fixes and upgrades to the search engine. I integrated full boolean operator support by modifying 
query_processor.hpp to correctly parse and sequentially apply the explicit AND, OR, and NOT operations, relying on new 
intersectPostings and unionPostings functions I added to ExactSearcher.hpp to manage document sets precisely. Additionally, 
I fixed the original functional bugs by ensuring the searchPhrase logic correctly enforced positional checks between adjacent
words. Finally, I addressed stability by adding header guards to PrefixSearcher.hpp to resolve redefinition errors, marked all 
read-only methods as const to ensure class integrity, and instructed the use of the C++17 standard flag for successful compilation
of modern C++ syntax.
