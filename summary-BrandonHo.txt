I created an initial prototype of the searchers (ExactSearcher, PrefixSearcher and the query_processor). These work efficiently relying on an index for efficient document travelling utilising hashmap and vector of pairs following term frequency and inverse document frequnecy.
The ExactSearcher class was supposed to handle single and multi-term queries by tokenising the inputs, fetching the postings and merging them using AND/OR in an efficient manner. 
While the query_processor conducts the retrieval and ranks them using the TF-IDF scores for top-K utilising a priority_queue.
The prefixsearcher which I added searches and gets data through the Prefix by utilising a Trie data structure.
However, in the end we didn't end up implementing the ExactSearcher.
